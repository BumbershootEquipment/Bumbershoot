	Our Story:
	Bumbershoot is the result of one conversation between the founders. Growing up with camping as primary weekend activity, we wondered why there wasn't an inexpensive and convenient service to rent high quality equipment for a weekend to escape the city.

	Before long, Bumbershoot was founded, making the weekend escape even easier.

	About the Founders:

	Carson (Tech Whiz): Descended from hearty midwestern stock, Carson was raised in the woods of North Carolina and acquired a taste for camping while a scout.  He is inordinately proud of the number of knots he still remembers.
